# dse.life-mirror
A clone of [dse.life](https://dse.life), which is now rebranded as [dse.chat](https://dse.chat). This repository aims to preserve and provide access to educational resources, including past papers and study materials, originally available on the site.

Due to github disk limit, I can't deploy the site, so wait til I turn my laptop to a server or I get a host lol

If you want the past papers directly from github, it's located in [static/pp](https://github.com/Lucasyh/dse.life-mirror/tree/main/static/pp)
